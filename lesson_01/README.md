# 📱 React Native - Lesson 01

Welcome to `lesson_01` — my first step into the world of **React Native**!  
In this project, I explored and practiced the core fundamentals of building mobile apps using React Native.

---

## 🚀 What I Learned

In this lesson, I learned how to:

- Use core React Native components:
  - `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `ScrollView`, `Pressable`, `Alert`, `TextInput` etc.
- Write platform-specific files using:
  - `.android.tsx` and `.ios.tsx`
- Create reusable components and manage props
- Style components using:
  - `StyleSheet`
  - `nativewind` (Tailwind CSS utility classes for React Native)
- Make HTTP requests using:
  - `axios`
- Structure my project for clarity and modularity
