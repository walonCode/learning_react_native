# 📱 React Native - Lesson 02

Welcome to `lesson_02` — my first step into the world of **React Native**!  
In this project, I explored more of the core components of react native and had a feel for data fetching and parsing using **axios libary**

## 🚀 What I Learned

In this lesson, I learned how to:

- Use core React Native components:
  - `Flatlist`, `ActivityIndicator`, `Expo Router`, `Alert`,  etc.
- Style components using:
  - `StyleSheet`
- Make HTTP requests using:
  - `axios`
- Structure my project for clarity and modularity
- Forms and input handling
- API integration with real data
